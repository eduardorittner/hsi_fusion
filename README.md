This repository contains all the code for my undergraduate research on Multispectral and Hyperspectral image fusion, as part of the Hyperspectral study group funded by the Eldorado Institute at the Computing and Automation Lab from UNICAMP.

# Paper
This repo contains the code forthe paper "Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion Using 3D Wavelet Transforms", however it does not contain the dataset used, because of its size.
